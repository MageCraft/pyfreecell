Installation
--------------

told that it can work with 2.0 PSP's.

Copy the folders Spider and %Spider to the /PSP/Game folder
on your PSP.

How To Play
-------------
- The aim of the game is to get rid of all of the cards.
- To get rid of cards you need to get a run from Ace (bottom)
  to King (Top) of cards in the same suit.
- You can move cards between stacks if last card of the
  stack you are moving to is one higher than the selected
  card. e.g. Ace goes on 2, 7 on 8, 10 on Jack etc.
- You can move individual cards, or groups of cards that are
  consecutive and the same suit.
- You can move cards into empty spaces.
- Any card that is face down will be turned over if there
  are no cards on top of it.
- When you run out of useful moves deal a card onto each
  stack. Note: Unlike many Spider versions you can deal if
  you have empty spaces.
